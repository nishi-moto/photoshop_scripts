<BR/>

## How to use: 


### Naming your artboards:

* In each artboard, name your file without the use of "_". Example: "NameOfYourArtboard".
* If you want it to be exported to PNG, simply and "_png" in the end of the name. So, the name will be "NameOfYourArboard_png". Same goes for PSD and JPG, so "NameOfYourArtboard_psd", for example.
* If you want to export the same file for multiple extensions, add the desired extension as already explained again. For example, "NameOfYourArtobard_psd_png_jpg" will export "NameOfYourArtobard.psd", "NameOfYourArtobard.png" and "NameOfYourArtobard.jpg".

### Using the script:
* In your Photoshop, go to File > Scripts > Browse ...
* Load the artboard_exporter.js file and wait. Voila!
* You will find your exported files in the "EXPORT" folder, one level abobe as your current psd file.
