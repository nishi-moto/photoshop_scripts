# Artboard Exporter

Made with [ExtendScript](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/scripting/estk.html).

Current supported formats: PNG, JPG and PSD

How to use: 

* In each artboard, name your file without the use of "_". Example: "NameOfYourArtboard".
* If you want it to be exported to PNG, simply and "_png" in the end of the name. So, the name will be "NameOfYourArboard_png". Same goes for PSD and JPG, so "NameOfYourArtboard_psd", for example.
* If you want to export the same file for multiple extensions, add the desired extension as already explained again. For example, "NameOfYourArtobard_psd_png_jpg" will export "NameOfYourArtobard.psd", "NameOfYourArtobard.png" and "NameOfYourArtobard.jpg".
